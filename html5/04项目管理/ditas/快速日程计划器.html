<p class="p">使用教程:How to use QuickLogger</p>
<p class="p">第一次打开该程序时会显示如下:When you first start up QuickLogger it will look
like this:</p>
<p class="p">Main QuickLogger window</p>
<p class="p">Every time you open the program the focus will be in the text box
at the top. If you want to, you can just type in your task name and
hit Enter—no mouse required. Below that text box is a list of saved
tasks. Static tasks, if selected, will always be at the top. Dynamic
tasks will be appended to the top of the dynamic task list as they
are entered into the text box.</p>
<p class="p">你可以点击<strong class="ph b">« View/Hide Options »</strong>&nbsp;以改变设置:To change the options,
click on the&nbsp;<strong class="ph b">« View/Hide Options »</strong>&nbsp;button. You will
see this:</p>
<p class="p">QuickLogger Options window</p>
<p class="p">Help Link</p>
<p class="p">The link to help will bring you to the&nbsp;<a class="xref" href="http://quicklogger.com/?page_id=10" target="_blank" rel="external noopener"><strong class="ph b">Help</strong></a>&nbsp;page here on the QuickLogger website.</p>
<p class="p">Window Placement:</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Top:</strong>&nbsp;This number indicates the number of pixels from
the top of your screen the top-left corner of the program will be
placed.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Left:</strong>&nbsp;This number indicates the number of pixels from
the left side of your screen the top-left corner of the program will
be placed.</p>
<p class="p">These settings can be adjusted incrementally so that the final
placement is where you want it.</p>
<p class="p">File Options</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Base File Name:</strong>&nbsp;This is the text that will be used
as a foundation for your log filenames. If you also have the rotation
setting on (it is by default), the date of the file will be appended
to this base name. For instance, your file may be called “Quicklog.xls”
or “QuickLog.2007-10-01.xls” or just “2007-10-01.xls”.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">File Type:</strong>&nbsp;QuickLogger will generate Excel Spreadsheets,
text files, basic&nbsp;HTML&nbsp;files, or CSV files. Each format
has its own benefits, and you can choose the one that fits your needs
best. Be aware: if you change formats after logging for a while, your
new file will not include the content in your old file type.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">File Path:</strong>&nbsp;This is the path where your log files should
be saved. If the program does not see the correct file in that directory
a few file will be created. Be Aware: if you specify a directory that
does not exist the program will generate an error.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Rotation:</strong>&nbsp;You can choose to rotate your task logs on
a daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, or yearly cycle. In each case,
a new file with the current date will be automatically generated on
the first day of the new period that you log something.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">First Day:</strong>&nbsp;This setting is used for weekly rotation.
It determines what day of the week is considered the first day.</p>
<p class="p">Task List Options</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">List Type:</strong>&nbsp;You have the ability to choose one of three
list types: Static, Dynamic, or Mixed. A Static list is useful if
you have recurring tasks that you want to track without having to
type them in over and over again. A Dynamic list is useful for keeping
track of your most recent tasks. A Mixed list provides the benefits
of both Static and Dynamic lists. With Mixed lists, your static tasks
appear at the top of the list and your most recent dynamic tasks appear
under that.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Total Tasks:</strong>&nbsp;You can control the number of tasks that
are saved and shown in the program with this number. This value includes
the total number of Static an Dynamic tasks if you have Mixed selected.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Static Tasks:</strong>&nbsp;This is the number of static tasks that
will appear in the list when you have Mixed selected.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">New Static List:</strong>&nbsp;When you click on this link you are
given an box to insert new Static tasks into your list. The new task
is placed at the top of the list, and the bottom task is bumped off
the list.</p>
